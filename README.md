The model simulates an epidemic in Switzerland and works as follows:

mesh_generator.py uses the border points of Switzerland in test.xlsx to create a mesh and saves it in the folder mesh

sir_model_adaptive.py solves the equations and saves pictures of the solution in Videomaker/Images

videomaker.py creates a video from the created images
